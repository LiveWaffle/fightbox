# FightBox

## Description
The FightBox is a flexible custom built FightBox for fighting games.

## Why I Made it
#### I've Always struggled with wrist pain growing up due to breaking both of them. When i started playing tekken 7 i realized that playing with a traditional FightStick/Controller would cause tons of pain in my wrists. I wanted to design something that was smaller but still use-able and wouldn't hurt my hands after long hours of use.
