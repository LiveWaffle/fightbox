# Hour 1
## [2025-06-23]
*For* The first hour I worked on relearning KiCad because the last time i used it was over a half a year ago! ***Wow!*** I started off by making the schematic. I started to use an RP-2040 as a base which would later be replaced by an Seeed ESP32c3. As i'm using it to play fighting games i wanted tactile switches unlike my fightstick which are slow clunky and straight up grimy feeling buttons. Plus it also causes me so much wrist pain due to its large area it takes up. So i created the schematic to use as little space as possible to reduce the pain inside my wrist.

# Hour 2
## [2025-06-24]
I worked on setting up the wiring for my PCBS. I tried to include a couple of nods to fighting games that i love and a watermark to remind me that i made that! There were a couple challanges with it though. With the changes of using circles instead of keycaps it would make it harder for me to figure out the correct spacing and rewiring over and over. I also figured out i needed to add through holes to the ESP32 in my pcb so i can wire backside and frontside!

# Hour 3
## [2025-06-25]
Today i worked on the case creating a small slick case that would fit on my desk which would be the size of a regular keyboard. I had troubles making the holes for the keys because it was annoying to do in fusion i had to take the buttons and scale them up and then extrude cutting the top layer. I'm excited to submit my project
